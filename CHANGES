Changes for GVS:

v4.21 (1/07/08)
----------------
1. Changed QC_TABLE_SIZE in level_1.c to 15000 (lines) to allow more lines in
   qc_parameter files, as requested by D. Marks.
2. Modified singlevos_2A-55 to correct a problem with saving the mudras file.

v4.20 (9/04/03)
----------------
1. Modified setvos.f to handle elevation angle of 0, which causes
   divide by 0 in computation of maximum range.
2. Modified gvs_metadata.c to use product version number from metadata file
   for level 3 HDF.
3. Modified 2A-54-dc to handle empty 2A-55 granules.
4. D. Silberstein corrected computation of bounding coordinates in
   gvs_metadata.c
5. Removed type specifier 'void' from main program in 2A54.cc and
   singlevos_2A-54-dc.cc in gvs/src/2A-54/src.  It was causing compile error.
6. Fixed problem in which libraries could not be built if a library didn't
   already exist in the target directory.  Brought configure.in up to date
   with autoconf version 2.53 standards.
7. Changed rain map accumulation programs to use variables passed as parameters
   for VOS time gap limits.  Previously, the maximum time gap allowed between
   VOSes was hard-coded at 75 minutes.  Time gaps within this limit were used
   as weighting factors for rain accumulation, but if time gap was greater then
   limit, VOS was rejected.  New scheme accepts two values: the first is a
   maximum for allowing time gap weighting as before, the second is a constant
   time gap to be used when actual gap exceeds first value.  VOSes are no
   longer rejected based on time gap.  New scheme was designed by Dave Marks.
8. Updated documentation.
9. Problem with errno in 2A-53/ver4/interpolate.cc and 2A-53/witek/rainest.c
   when compiling under Red Hat version 9, solved by Dave Augustine.

v4.19 (7/17/01)
----------------
1. Change <sys/time.h> to <time.h> in assortutil.cc, for portability.
2. ZR table indexing problem corrected in zr.c by Dave Marks and
   Dave Silberstein.

v4.18 (4/17/01)
----------------
1. Level II, Added 2A-53-dc (dual-cappi) algorithm.  Calls
   singlevos_2A-53-dc. (see below)
2. Level II, Removed singlevos_2A-54 dc algorithm for now due to
   concerns about algorithm using 3km gridded cappi.
3. Format conversion, modified 2A-53or2A-55 to support changes in
   2A-53
4. Updated documentation
5. Level I, added cluttermap to level_1_qc.c and level_1.c
6. Level II, modified procedure getField in mudras.cc to compare 'z' dimension
   of grid to value of 'NPlanes' from mudras header and return error if latter
   exceeds former.  Modified 2A54.cc to exit with error if mudras procedures
   return error.
   Added ZR tables and runtime files for KAMA and KLSX.
7. level_1/data Using automatically generated KWAJ cluttermap.
8. level_1/data updated with production versions of qc_params files, and added
   qc_params for NOAA and TOGA.
9. Y2K and other minor bug fixes.


v4.17 (6/28/00)
----------------
1. Format conversion, Y2K fix in level_1_ghdf_to_singlevos_uf.c
2. Level II, Initialized metadata structure in write_rrmap2hdf_file.c
3. Level III, Added product version option -P to level_3_finalize_metadata.c
4. gvslib, Fixed Y2K bug.
5. Level I, Modified level_1.c
   Writes VR data to UF file only if vrMask processing done.
   Fixed Y2K problem in filenames.
6  Level I, Modified vosqc.f
   Added a check for out-of-bounds array indices.
7. Level II, Added 2A-53/dual-cappi algorithm - singlevos_2A-53-dc
   a modification of 2A-53/ver4, extracts 2A-55 cappis 
   (1.5 km and 3 km) instead of calling sprint on 1C-51 to create a
   pseudo-cappi. The 1.5 km cappi is used for the inner 2A-53 disk 
   (15 km up to, but not including, 98 km) and the 3 km cappi
   for the outer 2A-53 disk (98 km through 150 km)
8. Level II, Added 2A-54/dual-cappi algorithm - singlevos_2A-54-dc
   similar to 2A-53-dc, uses 1.5 and 3 km cappis from 2A-55 to create 
   convective-stratiform map.  The 2A-54-dc algorithm is the same as 
   the Steiner algorithm used in 2A54.cc.
9. Level III, Fixed bug in acc_rrmaps_granule_hdf in which first VOS of last
   granule of processing period (period = END) was rejected.


v4.16 (2/17/00)
----------------
1. Level II, north/south bounding coordinate fixed.  See gvslib.
2. Level I, separate product version for 1B and 1C, -pgm, etc.
3. Level 1, takes the time from the first ray of the dataset and
   writes it to the radar header for filename-by-time tracking.
   For SIGMET data, Kwajelein data in particular,
   the first ray is not the earliest time.  The first ray time is
   around 20 seconds later than some other rays in the sweep.  No
   reordering of the rays is performed, therefore the first ray
   time is stored as the dataset time -- a policy decision.
4. Added intelligence to level_2_single_hdf_to_ghdf when looking for
   level 1 granules.  It will attempt to find a matching product number,
   failing that it will find the highest 1C product number.
5. level_2_singlevos_hdf_to_ghdf adds -m metadata.txt option.
6. 2A-53or2A-55 now calls level_2_singlevos_hdf_to_ghdf w/ '-m metadata.txt'.
7. Version numbers in *_metadata.txt are now integers ("1" and not "1.0").
8. Bug fix in all_tape_level_1n2 where it was setting the version number
   of all 2A-54 products to 1.
9. Automatically set the software_version in gvslib/gvs_metadata.h when
   configuring.


v4.15 (12/21/99)
----------------
1. Minor porting fixes for Redhat Linux.

v4.14 (12/10/99)
----------------
1. Adding configure and automake for portability.
   Removed all Makefiles replacing them w/ Makefile.am.
   Added several files for automake and configure support.

   All you need to do for installation is:

        configure --prefix=/whatever/dir/you/want/to/install
        make install

2. Removed HDF from gvslib.  They are back in RSL.  This solves
   a circular reference problem that occurs on sgi computers where
   the linker reports a problem with resolving symbols when there
   is no problem.

v4.13 (11/30/99)
----------------
1. Renamed libgvs_utils.a to libgvs.a.  Similiarly for the .so files.
   Also, created a gvslib/ and placed the build for libgvs* there.

2. Minor metadata changes for all programs.  Now we save
   the algorithm version, product version and software version 
   metadata items.  NOTE: toolkit 4.5r7 cannot store TK_SOFTWARE_VERSION --
   you must get toolkit 5.4.

3. Placed the RSL hdf routines into gvslib/.  They are removed from
   RSL.  Currently, rsl version 1.24.* and later versions.
   This affects the build for level_1.



v4.12 (9/21/98)
----------------
* Changed level_1 (v1.17):
  1. Modified vosqc.f to fix MIT problem.
  2. Modified level_1.c to recognize Kwaj 'DR' field.

* Requires rsl v1.19 or later

v4.11 (9/9/98)
----------------
* Fixed bug in 2A-52i -- Check TK_DEFAULT instead of -99.0 for 
  missing/badval. This fix affects the percentage of rain rate map.


v4.10 (8/18/98)
----------------
* Fixed ZR handling: format_conversion (v1.23)/, script/.
* Added kwaj_Dec1997Jan1998.zr: src/2A-53/ver4 (v4.10).
* Modified radar site determination code to handle MIT data files: level_1 (v1.16).

See 'CHANGES' in each component for more details.

v4.9.1 (8/14/98)
----------------
* Fixed the top Makefile to compile on tsdis01.

v4.9 (8/13/98)
----------------
* format_conversion (v1.22) - Changed level_1_hdf_to_uf to use prod version#
                            + from the input filename when naming output 
                            + filename.

                            + Moved HDF_FILE_VERSION definition from RSL file 
                            + into level_1.c.
                            + Requires rsl v1.18 or later.

* 2A-53-v4 (v4.9)           - Algorithm change regarding MISSING and NOECHO.
                            + The rain map range is defined by the ZR table.
                            + Added more zr tables.
                            + See it's CHANGES for more detail.

* 2A-54 (v2.20)             - Added explaination of noecho
                            + and missing/bad values to the html page.

* 2A-55 (v2.19)             - Added explaination of vertical
                            + profile and CFAD to the html page.


* Requires rsl v1.18 or later-- This version removes ZDR data from 1C-51 HDF.

See 'CHANGES' in each component for more details.

v4.8.1 (7/27/98)
----------------
* level_1 (v1.14)           - Modified level_1_qc.c. No longer QCs ZDR data.
                              Experimental only.

* 2A-53-w (v3.13)           - Changed the Makefile to compress the data 
                            + files back after installation.

* Added warning messages in the installation section in README.
* Fixed the top Makefile, so 'make clean' will clean src/utils.


See 'CHANGES' in each component for more details.

v4.8 (6/15/98)
---------------

* format_conversion (v1.21) + Fixed bug in 'level_1_ghdf_to_singlevos_uf' --
                            + the product # field in the output filename was
                            + incorrect.

* level (v1.13)             - Requires gv_utils v1.8.
                            + Gets radar site information from a central
                            + radar site data file in gv_utils: 
                            + $GVS_DATA_PATH/gv_radar_site_info.data.
                            + Removed file 'radar_sites'.

* 2A-53 (v3.20)             - Compressed carttopol* and poltocart* in 
                            + witek/data.

* 2A-53-w (v3.12)           - Compressed carttopol* and poltocart*.
                            + Compressed files reduce the 
                            + package administrative time ('cvs tag').

* Requires gv_utils v1.8 or higher.

* All three level programs get radar site information from a central radar 
  site info file: $GVS_DATA_PATH/gv_radar_site_info.data (in package
  'gv_utils').

* Minor updates to the top html pages.

See 'CHANGES' in each component for more details.


** Note: **

   Level_1 is unable to process Berrimah data that is in RAPIC format.
   The reason is simple to explain but hard to implement.  Azimuth
   angles of one field type are shifted in other field types.
   This makes alignment of a field type for a particular ray problematic.
   Additionally, upper level sweeps are similarly misaligned.  The 
   current implementation of the TSDIS toolkit requires that the
   rays be properly aligned across all field types and all sweeps.


v4.7 (6/9/98)
--------------
* format_conversion (v1.20) - Fixed bug in 'level_2_singlevos_hdf_to_ghdf' 
                            + w.r.t. option '-r' (This affects 
                            + all_tape_level_1n2).

* level (v1.12)             - Corrected WSR88D_ID for Miami and Key West in
                            + radar_sites.
                            + Added qc_params_DARB, qc_params_TAMP, 
                            + qc_params_MIAM, qc_params_KEYW,
                            + qc_params_LKCH, qc_params_NWBR, qc_params_CORC.
                            + qc_params_JACK, qc_params_TALL, qc_params_BROW, 
                            + qc_params_GRAN, qc_params_TAMU,
                            + qc_params_HAWA, qc_params_THPH.

* 2A-53 (v3.19)             - Fixed the pathname for the logo and the 
                            + background in the HTML page.

                            + Changed 2A-53 to execute in a tmp dir.
                            + Requires gv_utils v1.5

					all_tape_1C-51 determins whether tape header file 
                    of KMLB is normal and only passes it to 1C-51 if that 
                    file is normal. File read from tape is named, tapeid.###, 
                    where ### starts at 0.

   variable, 'GTS_DATA_PATH', and directories' name created by 
   'all_tape_level_1n2' as well.


v2.5.5 (froze: 4/1/96)
----------------------
1. 1C-51 (v2.6)   - Minor mod. in doc., options' default, all_tape_1C-51. 
                    Compression of UF file is not done by 1C-51 but by
                    all_tape_1C-51.
2. 2A-52i (v2.3)  - Uses 2A-53 product (rain rate map) as input instead of 
                    1C-51 product. Have new command line syntax.
3. 2A-53-a (v3.4) - Takes 2A-54 product as input on the command line. However
                    the actual algorithm program currently doesnot use it.
4. 2A-53-d (v3.4) - Added -P data_path, changed the default location for the 
                    data files (i.e., $GVS_DATA_PATH/data_file), and made 
                    csmapfile a mandatory input.
5. 2A-54 (v2.5)   - Minor fixes for compiling on the SGI. Minor script changes.
6  2A-55 (v2.4)   - Minor fixes for compiling on the SGI. Minor script changes.
7. all_tape supports 2A-53-d. It can determine if data is Lassen and pre-append
                    '-t L' to the option list for programs that require radar
                    type be specified; such programs are: 2A-53-a, 2A-54, 2A-55
8. Top-level Makefile is more robust.
9. Minor mod. in uf2mudras and all makefiles.
10. Requires: uiowa_distrib-v2.2.tgz, rsl-v0.44.tgz, and sprint-v1.7.tgz.

v2.5.4 (froze: 3/21/96)
----------------------
1. 1C-51(v2.5)    - Minor algo/parameter (runtime) changes.
2. 2A-52i (v2.2)  - No change.
3. 2A-53-a (v3.3) - Minor changes. 
4. 2A-53-d (v3.3) - No change. However, not part of the all_tape... scripts.
5. 2A-54 (v2.4)   - Minor script changes.  Minor bug fix w.r.t. date handling.
6. 2A-55 (v2.3)   - Minor script changes.
7. uiowa_distrib-v2.2.tgz.
8. rsl-v0.44.tgz.
9. sprint-v1.6.tgz.
10. all_tape scripts modified, including uf2mudras script.

Data flow tested: 1C-51, 2A-52i, 2A-53-a, 2A-54, 2A-55.
                  2A-53-d was not tested via the all_tape scripts, however,
                  it seems to run fine.  Look for it in a later GVS
                  release.

Platforms: HP, SGI, LINUX

v2.5.1 (froze 9/11/95)
-------------------

o   Danny has split the 2A-53 (stacycs) program, which did too much,
    into two parts: 2A-53 and 3A-53.  The specific programs are stacycs
    and stacycs3a53, respectively.

o   2A-53 (Anton Kruger's program) uses new U. of Iowa distribution package 
    -- uf2rle doesnot depend on TRMM radar library.

o   2A-53 Anton program supports MELBOURNE and DARWIN dataset.

o   2A-54 includes auxiliary data files (for MELBOURNE data) and 
    basescan data files. 

o   2A-53-a and 2A-54 contain new and modified options.

o   'all_tape_level_1n2' produces output with new filename's extension 
    for '2A-52i' and 2A-55-a'.

o   'all_tape_level_1n2' compresses 1C-51 product (UF file), 
    uncompresses the compressed file to process level 2 product(s), 
	and recompresses it again when done processing with that file in order 
	to save disk space.  In addition, this script changed the block size 
	of 'dd' to 32K from 64k.

o   Containes GV pre-ops problems fixes.

v2.5 (froze 7/19/95)
-------------------
o   This release uses the science algorithms instead of the simple simon 
    algorithms.

o   'all_tape_level_1n2' has changed to due to the new requirements for 
    running science algorithms.

	'2A-53' product does not require 2A-54 product as input, so it doesnot 
	have to be run last.  

	The messages print out to stderr might be slightly different from 
	the previous release.
