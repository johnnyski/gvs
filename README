v4.21 (1/07/08)

This is the README file for the Ground Validation Software (GVS). GVS 
contains software to produce the following products:

1.  level_1 -   GV calibrated radar data (1B-51) and 
                quality controlled radar reflectivity (1C-51)
2.  2A-52i  -   Rain existence
3.  2A-53   -   Rain rate
4.  2A-54   -   Convective/Stratiform map
5.  2A-55   -   3-D reflectivity map 
6.  2A-56   -   Rain gauge
7.  2A-57   -   Disdrometer
8.  3A-53   -   5-Day Rainfall Map
9.  3A-54   -   Site Rainfall Map
10. 3A-55   -   Monthly 3-D Structure

See src/$product/README for more information on the specific product.

NOTE: Version numbers are set in two places in the gvs package.
      One file is $GVS_DATA_PATH/product_version_numbers and the other
      is a product specific $GVS_DATA_PATH/????_metadata.txt files.

      I.  Filenames, ie. the output *.HDF or *.hdf files, have a product
          version number that is obtained by reading the
          '$GVS_DATA_PATH/product_version_numbers' file.

      II. Internal metadata, ie. ProductVersion, for each HDF or hdf file
          is obtained by reading the '$GVS_DATA_PATH/????_metadata.txt'.
          
      This means that the product version number that is part of the
      filename can be different from the internal metadata 'ProductVersion'.
      At some point this scheme should be merged in favor of the more
      flexible ????_metadata.txt solution.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1.  The required libraries are:
    Note:  GVS products are compatible with the current or future versions
    of the software below unless specified otherwise; it is best to use the
    highest version. Please contact the owner of those software for any 
    update with bug fixes.

    - HDF4.1* -- Obtain via anonymous ftp to ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in HDF.
                 This is guarenteed to install on newer op/sys --
                 especially Linux Redhat.  HDF4.0* works too, if you
                 can install it on your system or if it is already installed.

    - toolkit-v5.4 -- Available at 
        http://tsdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/tsdis/tsdistk.html.
      
	- rsl-v1.27.tgz, 

    - sprint-v1.13.tgz,

	- gv_utils-v1.15.tgz, and

    - pbmplus.tgz (Optional. This is needed to create image only.) 
        -- Obtain via anonymous ftp to trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov in pub/software or
        -- http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/trmm_office/index.html.


2. The required GNU package(s) are available via ftp to ftp.uu.net.
   The package(s) are:

	make and perl

3. Compilers:  C++, C, and Fortran. Configure will check for these.
   
4. Platform:  HP, SGI, or Linux (Tested for SGI & Linux)


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------
1. Make sure the required software packages are built and installed.
   Then, YOU MUST BUILD GVSLIB AND INSTALL IT FIRST.  Then, you can
   build the remaining package.

   configure --prefix=/some/dir/for/install
   make install       -- Installs libgvs.* first, then continues to
                         install all the other software.

   -- OR --

   cd src/gvslib
   make install       -- To only install libgvs.

   cd ../..           -- As a separate step you can install the rest of
   make install          the package.

   Note: if errors occur during installation of libgvs, try the
   following command from the gvs directory:

   ltconfig ltmain.sh

   Then run 'make install' again.

2. Type 'make clean' to free up space (optional).

3. Set the shell environment variable, GVS_DATA_PATH, to be the same
   as the --prefix above.  $(prefix)/data is where things are installed.
   $(prefix) is not a defined variable, I use it for illustration.

4. Add the $(prefix)/bin  to your path.

5. Set the shell environment variable, TSDISTK, to where you installed TSDIS 
   toolkit package.  Typically this will be $(prefix)/toolkit.

6. MAKE SURE $TSDISTK/config is world writable, or writeable by everyone
   in the group (unix group).  Basically, anyone using this software must
   be able to write to $TSDISTK/config.

7. As root, create '/dev/null' with 'rw' permission for all users, if it 
   does not exist.  It is very rare that /dev/null is not defined.  But,
   I wouldn't mention it, if I hadn't seen it.

            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


(a) Documentation is located in doc/gvs_index.html and can be viewed with 
    netscape or mosaic.

(b) The directories which you have installed the executable files for 
     'gvs', 'pbmplus', and 'sprint' packages should be in your search path.



EXECUTION NOTES:
----------------
1. Set enviroment variables: $GVS_DATA_PATH and $TSDISTK.

2. Read 'EXECUTION NOTES' from the README file and doc/gvs_index.html
   for product's specific execution requirements and 
   options.  *.html can be viewed with Mosaic or netscape.

3. Check $GVS_DATA_PATH/gv_radar_site_info.data and make sure it contains 
   information for your data site.


KNOWN BUGS/PROBLEMS:
====================

1. Level_1 is unable to process Berrimah data that is in RAPIC format.
   The reason is simple to explain but hard to implement.  Azimuth
   angles of one field type are shifted in other field types.
   This makes alignment of a field type for a particular ray problematic.
   Additionally, upper level sweeps are similarly misaligned.  The 
   current implementation of the TSDIS toolkit requires that the
   rays be properly aligned across all field types and all sweeps.

2. The software may not work for radar sites other than the following known 
   GV sites: Darwin, Melbourne, Kwajalein, Houston, Corpus CHristi, Guam, 
   Israel, Key West, Lake Charles, Miami, New Braunfel, Sao Paulo, Tampa Bay, 
   Omkoi, and Taiwan.
