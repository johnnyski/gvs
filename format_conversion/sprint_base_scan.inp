C       Sprint Script for Base scan Interpolation

* Further documentation for sprint and the complete format of this
* file can be found in the GVS documentation.
*
C  NOTES on the format of this file:
C    1. Comments in this file must be 'C  ', NOTE THE TWO SPACES
C       following the C, or '*' in column one (1).
C    2. NO BLANK LINES please, but, blank comment are ok.
C    3. Each field, be it character or number is 8 ascii characters wide.
C
*
* This is the format of sprint directives (commands) used.
* All directives must start in column 1 and be uppercase.
* Each field, and the options for the directive, including the directive,
* is 8 characters wide.  Except for INPUT:rewindstr, that field is one
* character wide.
* 
*
* The '<' and '>' delimit a field, but, are not part of the format of the
* file.  They are present only to show the layout of the fields in this
* description.  And, spaces are for readability only.  The first entry in
* the angle brackets represents the logical name of the option.  The second
* entry indicates the datatype and length in ascii bytes.
*
* When a field is missing, only spaces exist to fill the gap.
* '\' means continued on next line and is not part of the file format.  It 
* is only provided here for readibility.  All sprint directives (commands)
* are completely contained on one line of this file.

* INTERP (I hope you get the idea.)
*
* Special GVS processing:
*     The program 'uf2mudras', a perl program, makes the following
*     substitutions in this file:
*
*     RADAR_NUM      is replaced by the radar number for experiment 24.
*                    The radar number is hard coded in sprint.  This
*                    number must match the radar number in the file
*                    /usr/local/trmm/GVBOX/data/gv_radar_site_info.data.
*     YYMMDD         is replaced with the date of the data.
*     VERTICAL_RES   is replaced by the vertical resolution. Default 1km.
*     HORIZONTAL_RES is replaced by the horizontal resolution. Default 1km.
