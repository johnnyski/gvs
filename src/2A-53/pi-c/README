README for 2A-53-c PI-C algorithm (12/10/99).  Packaged w/ gvs 4.14.

This is a super simple simon algorithm and is meant as a place
holder 2A-53 algorithm for TSDIS processing.  This may be the 
DAY 1 algorithm.  Output is HDF.

  Executable files:
  ----------------
  * 2A-53-c - The perl script, the front end to PI-C algorithm program.
	          This produces product for one hour-granule.
  * singlevos_2A-53-c - The perl script, the front end to PI-C
              algorithm program.  This produces product for a single VOS.
  * 2A53c   - Actual algorithm program.

EXECUTION NOTES:
================
'alltape_level_1n2' calls 2A-53 (in format_conversion/) which 
calls singlevos_2A-53-c which calls 2A53c.

2A-53 works on HDF granules (one hour granules).

singlevos_2A-53-c works for HDF files with only one volume scan present.

2A53c (2A53c.c) reads the raw data, C/S map, and outputs HDF.
