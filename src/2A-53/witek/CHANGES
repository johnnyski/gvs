CHANGES in Witek Krajewski's program:
----------------------------------

v4.20 (9/02/03)
---------------------------------------------
1. When compiling interpolate.cc under Red Hat version 9, the following error
   message was received:

     In function `system_call(char*)':
     /home/dmarks/trmm/gvs-v4.20/src/2A-53/ver4/interpolate.cc:293: undefined
     reference to `__errno_location()'

   This was fixed by adding "#include <errno.h>" and commenting out an "extern"
   declaration for errno.  Thanks to Dave Augustine for this solution.

v3.13 (7/27/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.8.1
----------------------------------------------
1. Changed the Makefile to compress the data files back after installation.

v3.12 (6/15/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.8
-----------------------------------------
1. Compressed carttopol* and poltocart*.

v3.11 (8/19/97) (Packaged with GVS 4.0) 
-----------------------------------------
1. Removed option -t; added option -S.
2. singlevos_2A-53-w can determine site name from the uf file if it is not
   specified on the command line.

v3.10 (4/30/97)
----------------
1. Fixed the Makefile w.r.t. install_doc and linking.
2. Changed 'change_perl_path' to 'install_scripts' in the Makefile.

v3.9 (1/6/97)
--------------
1. Changed 'install_doc' in Makefile

v3.8 (12/12/96)
---------------
1. Traps signals (SIGINT, SIGFPE, SIGKILL, SIGILL, SIGSEGV)
   and abort execution for 'rainest', 'out.x', and 'prep_proc'.
2. Ported to Sun.
3. Added a new exit code, -2, for interruption.
4. Check if prep_proc produced no output file, then exit with code = -1.
5. Removed 2A-53-w.

v3.7.2 (10/30/96)
----------------
1. Fixes problem of a NULL string radar name wherein the intermediate
   rle file placed "" in the file and the 'out.x' program could
   not 'scanf' it.

2. This version requires toolkit 3.0 as TKwriteGrid will bomb with
   2.5.

v3.7.1 (9/6/96)
---------------
1. Removed 'exit' when encountering bad header info.  This includes
   checks for invalid date information.  This is a patch release for
   processing for the AIW-II.


v3.7 (7/10/96)
--------------
1. Fixed compiling bug for SGI in prep_proc.c.
2. Includes the latest update of the algorithm (6/28/96).  This version
   uses -99 for out-of-boundary data.
3. Default parameters files are changed.
4. Added [-v] in prep_proc.c; modified rainest.c to reflect this change.
5. Changed in prep_proc.c, w.r.t. using RSL internal storage to floating 
   point conversion function.
6. Added a new return code, 1, in 2A-53-w for failure occurred during
   processing for some VOS but could continue for other VOSs.
7. Modified in product.c so program will produce rain rate map for input
   data file having less than eight sweeps.
8. Need to patch $gvs/IO_INTR_GV.c.diff to $toolkit/src/IO_INTR_GV.c 
   (toolkit v2.5).

v3.6 (6/25/96)
--------------
1. Uses new source code obtained from the University of Iowa.  This version
   does not require uiowa_distrib package.
2. Output filename is required on the command line.
3. Lookup tables are not copied to the working directory by the script--
   'rainest' uses data path to access them.
4. Produces product in HDF file.
5. Added singlevos_2A-53-w.
6. Changed the program name to '2A-53-w'.
7. Re-incorporated mods made in uiowa_distrib v2.2.  RLE files are still
   being produced.  The program 'prep_proc' does it.
   a. Reading UF (compressed, uncompressed)
   b. Conversion functions HMLF and aiw_invf.  Rounding error for Lassen.
   c. Check for NOECHO on rle read.
8. Relies on having RSL.  At the time of this writing, version 0.45.
9. Requires TSDIS Toolkit and HDF libraries.
10. Requires programs in $GVS/format_conversion

v3.5 (5/1/96)
--------------
1. Changed gts to gvs.


v3.4 (4/1/96)
--------------
1. Requires 2A-54 product for input (This just provides the interface. The 
   algorithm does not use it now).
2. Changed the makefile.

v3.3 (3/21/96)
--------------
* Minor mod. to the script.
* Bug fixes.
* Uses uiowa_distrib version 2.2.  This means it is using RSL 0.43 or higher
  which  includes code for transparently reading gzip-ed files.


v3.2 (3/4/96)
-------------
* Bug fixes.
* Changed default value for wflag, ars, arc, htopc, and htops.
* rainest.c: 
	- use "height.DR","carttopol.DR", "poltocart.DR" if radar_index != 1.
* The following files have been modified to handle bad data: 
    rainest.h, instfield.c, product.c, readray.c
* Requires uiowa_distrib-v2.1.tgz

v3.1 (12/12/95)
--------------
*  Removed rsl from the software requirement section (this was not needed). 
*  Added gvs.gif
-From Manos:
>>The subroutines that have been modified are:
>>rainest.c : I included a new parameter "shiftmin" which represents
>>            the time shift between gage and radar data.
>>products.c: The "yearp/monp/dayp/hourp/minp" are assigned in products.c
>>            subroutine at the lowest sweep (sweep.number = 0).
>>accumulation.c: The "yearp/monp/dayp/hourp/minp" are not assigned in this
>>                subroutine any more.
>>The year constrain has been removed from all subroutines.

v3.0 (9/11/95)
-------------
*  'rainest' supports Melbourne data in addition to Darwin data.
*  When running 2A-53-a, the default of data_type is Melbourne instead
   of Darwin.

v2.0 (7/19/95):
--------------
The changes are necessary to integrate into NASA TRMM GVS and to run
on HP and SGI machines.

*  Changes in 'rainest.h':
	from

	#define CLASSES_PATH  "/usr/local/data/hml_data/trmm/aiw/products/BER/1994/jan/rain/instantaneous/classes"
	#define PRODUCT_PATH1 "/usr/local/data/hml_data/trmm/aiw/products/BER/1994/jan/rain/accumulations/advection"
	#define PRODUCT_PATH2 "/usr/local/data/hml_data/trmm/aiw/products/BER/1994/jan/rain/instantaneous/advection"

   to 

	#define CLASSES_PATH  "."
	#define PRODUCT_PATH1 "."
	#define PRODUCT_PATH2 "."


*  Don't use index table. So scan every sweep from the input file.

*  Output file (from writeminute() is not compressed).

*  Commented out printf()'s.

*  Search for poltocart.tbl and carttopol.tbl from the current directory.

*  Call writeminute() for any day.

*  Defined global variables in 'rainest.c' instead of 'rainest.h' and 
   reference to them using 'extern'.  This is so to compile on the
   SGI machine.
