CHANGES for 2A-54:

v4.20 (6/??/03)
----------------
1. Modified 2A-54-dc to handle empty 2A-55 granules.
2. Removed type specifier 'void' from main program in 2A54.cc and
   singlevos_2A-54-dc.cc in gvs/src/2A-54/src.  It was causing compile error.

v4.17 (6/28/00)
----------------
1. Added 2A-54/dual-cappi algorithm - singlevos_2A-54-dc. Similar to 2A-53-dc,
   it extracts 2A-55 cappis (1.5 km and 3 km) instead of calling sprint on
   1C-51 to create a pseudo-cappi. The 1.5 km cappi is used when range is from
   15 km to 98 km, and the 3 km cappi for ranges of 98 km through 150 km.
   The 2A-54-dc algorithm is the same as the Steiner algorithm used in 2A54.cc.

v2.21 (11/19/99) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.13
----------------------------------------------

v2.1 (Froze 9/11/95)
-------------------
o Added internal data files for processing Melbourne data.
o Fixed bug with respect to ZR conversion filename and working map.

  to -T threshold.

  segmentation violation.

o Set default value for img_height, img_width, altitude, and pix_res.
