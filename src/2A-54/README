EXECUTION NOTES:
================

*  This product uses a format conversion program called, 'uf2mudras' along 
   with sprint input template called, 'sprint_base_scan.inp' to interpolate
   the base scan of the UF file.  They are located in
   'GVS_ROOT/format_conversion'.  You may create your own template as 
   long as the following rules are applied:
		-   Specify '10' for Fortran logical unit number of the input file 
			in 'input' command.
   		- 	Specify '11' for Fortran logical unit number of the output file 
			in 'output' command.  
        -   Fill in 'YYMMDD' for field 2 of the 'PROCESS' command.
            This script will substitude 'YYMMDD' with the actual 
            date of radar data. 
        -   Fill in 'RADAR_NUM'for field 6 of the 'INPUT' command. This 
			script will substitude 'RADAR_NUM' with either 23 or 21 for 
			Lassen or Melbourne data, respectively.

   See NCAR SPRINT documentation for command syntax.
