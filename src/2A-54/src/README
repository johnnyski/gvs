README file for 2A-54 (Convective-Stratiform Map)
-------------------------------------------------

This is an intermediate version of 2A-54.  While it is much more 
straightforward to run than the original version, there is still a lot of 
extraneous code.  This will be eliminated in the near future.

To create an executable version, type "make".

To run, type "2A54 [input mudras base scan] [site name] [full output path]"
	[site name] will currently accept only
	   ber -> Darwin
	   mel -> Melbourne
	   ict -> Wichita (used for testing but will be removed eventually)

The output files are ASCII, convective/stratiform maps.  These maps are
151x151 cartesian grids with the radar located at center of grid box at 
location (76,76).  The entries are unitless as follows:
	 0 -> no rain
	 1 -> stratiform
	 2 -> convective
	-99 -> missing/bad data

There are a couple test files included in the testfiles directory.  The
input mudras basescan files are named *.pure and the output csmaps are
named appropriately.

If you have any questions or problems, let me know.
