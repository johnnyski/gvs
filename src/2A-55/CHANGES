   (toolkit v2.5)

v2.6 (Froze: 6/25/96)
--------------------
Modifications to 2A-55, as submitted by the University of Washington,
and different from GVS 2.5.5 versions, are as follows:

1. Output HDF files using TSDIS toolkit 2.5 (Patch of $gvs/IO_GV.h.diff to
   $toolkit/include/IO_GV.h) and HDF 4.0r1p1.

2. Bug fix w.r.t. CFAD and Vertical profile output dimension.
   For CFAD: 12x86.  For Vertical profile: 12 columns X #z-planes rows.
   The number of CFAD's is the #z-planes.

3. Added two routines for TSDIS toolkit incorporation, for output to HDF:
   a. output_hdf.cc
   b. write_grid_to_hdf.c

4. The top level script, 2A-55 modified to take 2A-54 in HDF.
   The script will call '2A-54_hdf2ascii' to convert it to ascii.

5. Requires output filename prefix to be specified on the command line.
   Modified CC files: 2A55.cc, VOLio.cc.

6. Script 2A-55 automatically checks for the envrionment variable TSDISTK.
   It sets it to the default /usr/local/toolkit_2.5, if necessary.

7. Added singlevos_2A-55.

8. Requires programs from $GVS/format_conversion.

9. Added lat/lon and time information.  But, is lat/lon in the input
   mudras.pure file?  I only see 0.0/0.0 for lat/lon.

10. Add -M save_mudras_fname option.

--------------------
1. Changed gts to gvs.

* Uses algorithm from The University of Washington.
* Added gvs.gif
* Requiress 2A-54 product and its required software.
* Executable files, 2A-55-a and 2A-55-c, are removed; instead, 2A-55 is 
  created which produces three products: 2A-55-a (Cube), 2A-55-b (Vertical 
  profile), and 2A-55-c (CFAD).

v2.0 (Froze 7/19/95)
---------------------
???
