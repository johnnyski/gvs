EXECUTION NOTES:
================

*  This product uses a format conversion program called, 'uf2mudras' along 
   with sprint input template called, 'sprint_entire_volume.inp' to interpolate
   the entire volume scan of the UF file.  They are located in 
   'GVS_ROOT/format_conversion'.  You may create your own template as long as
   the following rules are applied:
		-   Specify '10' for Fortran logical unit number of the input file 
			in 'input' command.
   		- 	Specify '11' for Fortran logical unit number of the output file 
			in 'output' command.  
        -   Fill in 'YYMMDD' for field 2 of the 'PROCESS' command.
            This script will substitude 'YYMMDD' with the actual 
            date of radar data. 
        -   Fill in 'RADAR_NUM'for field 6 of the 'INPUT' command. This 
			script will substitude 'RADAR_NUM' with either 23 or 21 for 
			Lassen or Melbourne data, respectively.

   See NCAR SPRINT documentation for command syntax.

*  Only one execution of this product is allowed in a particular directory if 
   the provided sprint input template is used.

Requirements:

*  Have access to the executable files located in $GVS/format_conversion,
   sprint, and in ./src.
 
*  Have 'sprint_entire_volume.inp' located in 'GVS_ROOT/format_conversion'
   installed under $GVS_DATA_PATH if you don't want to specify 
   '-s sprint_input_template'.

* Set enviroment variables: $GVS_DATA_PATH and $TSDISTK

* Install gv_utils' data under $GVS_DATA_PATH.
