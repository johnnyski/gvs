CHANGES for 2A-56


v1.4 (5/29/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.6
------------------------------------------------
* Added the capability for uninstalling the software.

v1.3 (1/26/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.5
------------------------------------------------
* Modified granulate_gmin_files to insert TSDIS 4 char symbol for gv_site in
  place of NWS radar symbol. Removed some hardwiring, relating to unknown radar
  sites.  This code did not provide any utility because files created with UNKN
  for radar cannot be distributed or used in analysis.  There needs to be a
  better convention for flagging such cases


v1.2 (11/13/97) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.2
------------------------------------------------
* Bug fixes w.r.t. argument list.

v1.1 (10/24/97) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.1
