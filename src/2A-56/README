2A-56 contains the following executable files and documentations:

    * gmin_to_granule_ascii - The perl script, user interface, that produces
                              monthly granule ascii files of gmin data 
                              (rain gauge).
    * granulate_gmin_files  - The perl script that granulizes the input gmin 
                              files into multiple gmin files (monthly
                              granules). This program is called by 
                              'gmin_to_granule_ascii'.

EXECUTION NOTES:
================

Proper usage of the programs in the 2A-56 Ground Validation Software (GVS):

1. gmin_to_granule_ascii *.gmin
 
   This creates one monthly granule for each gauge; for each
   gauge there will be at most 12 granules per year.

2. Ship the *.ascii files to TSDIS or the Goddard DAAC.
