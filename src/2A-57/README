2A-57 contains the following executable files and documentations:
  * disdro_to_granule_ascii - The perl script, user interface, that produces
                              monthly granule ascii files of disdrometer data.
  * granulate_disdro_files -  The perl script that granulizes the input 
                              disdrometer files into multiple files (monthly
                              granule).  This program is called by 
                              'disdro_to_granule_ascii'.

EXECUTION NOTES:
================
Proper usage of the programs in the 2A-56 Ground Validation Software (GVS):

1. disdro_to_granule_ascii *.gmin
 
   This creates one monthly granule for each disdrometer; for each
   disdrometer there will be at most 12 granules per year.

2. Ship the *.ascii files to TSDIS or the Goddard DAAC.


Does not require GSL.  These programs manipulate the ascii files only.
