README for 3A-55: v1.6 (12/10/99) packaged w/ GVS v4.14.

Version 4.0 algorithms for level 3 for the TRMM Ground Validation Program.

Contents:


   3A-55     - Mainline code to process granules (input and output).
               Critical arguments are BEGIN, MIDDLE, END.  These
               control when accumulations are performed and when 
               the final HDF files are produced.

   3A-55_ascii2hdf - Called by 3A-55 for END.
                     Input is ASCII for both CFADS and Vertical
                     profiles, and metadata (binary form).
                     Output is 3A-55 HDF product.

   level_3_accu_cfad  - Called by 3A-55 for BEGIN, MIDDLE and END.  Output
                        is ready for 3A-55_ascii2hdf.

   level_3_accu_vprof - Called by 3A-55 for BEGIN and MIDDLE.  Output is
                        a binary intermediate file that must be
                        processed through level_3_mean_vprof to produce
                        the ascii file for 3A-55_ascii2hdf.

   level_3_mean_vprof - Called by 3A-55 for END.  Read the intermediate
                        file of level_3_accu_vprof and output ascii.


   level_2_dump_metadata - Dump level 2 granule (HDF) metadata to STDOUT
                           in binary form.  (you'll get a mess on your
                           terminal, if you forget to redirect the output!)

   level_3_finalize_metadata - Modify a binary metadata file (the structure
                               is in ../utils/hdf_metadata.h) with additional
                               metadata items specified on the command
                               line.
