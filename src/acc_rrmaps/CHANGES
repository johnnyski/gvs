CHANGES for acc_rrmaps

v4.20 (4/18/2003)
-------------------------------------------------
* Modifications to gvs/src/acc_rrmaps/acc_rrmaps_granule_hdf:
- Changed to use two new command line parameters for computing weighting factor
  VOS time gaps.  Previously, the maximum time gap allowed between VOSes
  was hard-coded at 75 minutes.  Time gaps within this limit were used as
  weighting factors for rain accumulation, but if time gap was greater then
  limit, VOS was rejected.  New scheme accepts two values: max_time_gap and
  const_time_gap. max_time_gap is the maximum for allowing time gap weighting
  as before, and const_time_gap is a constant time gap to be used when actual
  gap exceeds first value.  VOSes are no longer rejected based on time gap.
  New scheme was designed by Dave Marks.
- Added code to compare previous time gap parameters to current as
  a sanity check.  Time gap parameters are stored in a file in the 3A-54
  directory, providing a record of what was used in the accumulation.
- Also prettied up subroutine argument lists and misaligned comments.

5/31/01
-------------------------------------------------
* Change <sys/time.h> to <time.h> in assortutil.cc, for portability.

5/09/00
-------------------------------------------------
* Fixed bug in acc_rrmaps_granule_hdf, where first VOS of last granule of
  a processing period ("END" flag) was rejected.
  Fixed bug that prevented HDF from being produced on Linux.

v1.5 (5/29/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.6
-------------------------------------------------
* Added more diagnostic messages.
* Fixed interrupt signal checking.
* Changed in acc_rrmaps_granule_hdf: Not redirect output to /dev/null.
* Corrected the multifactor calculation and accumulation of maps 
  in 'acc_rrmaps_granule_hdf'-- Note: This affects 3A-53 and 3A-54 products.
* Added the capability for uninstalling the software.
