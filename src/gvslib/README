LINKING APPLICATIONS:
=====================

If you want HDF and TSDIS toolkit libraries (the link line looks messy),
you will need to have -lgvs too.  This library is part of gvs.  The
HDF routines are specific for gvs level_1 processing.  Additionally,
RSL may be installed to support additional formats and -letor -limplode
may be required.

   setenv TSDISTK /usr/local/toolkit  (or your top-level directory name)

   -L/usr/local/trmm/GVBOX/lib \
   -lrsl -lgvs -L/usr/local/hdf/lib  -L/usr/local/toolkit/lib \
   -ltsdistk -lmfhdf -ldf -ljpeg -lz -lm

   Be sure to substitute the appropriate -L specification for the HDF
   and the TSDISTK library paths on your system.
