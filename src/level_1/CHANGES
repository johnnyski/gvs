2. Modified level_1_qc.c :
   Added function 'add_calibr_factor()' to adjust CZ values
   by the Z_calibr_factor.

v1.17 (9/21/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.12
----------------------------------------------
1. Modified vosqc.f to fix MIT problem.
2. Modified level_1.c to recognize Kwaj 'DR' field.
3. Requires rsl v1.19 or later

v1.16 (8/18/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.10
----------------------------------------------
1. Modified radar site determination code to handle MIT data files.


v1.15 (8/13/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.9
-----------------------------------------------
1. Small bug fix in level_1_qc.c
2. Moved HDF_FILE_VERSION definition from RSL file into level_1.c
3. HDF_FILE_VERSION = 2.
4. Requires rsl v1.18 or later -- This version removes ZDR data from 1C-51 HDF.

v1.14 ((7/27/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.8.1
-----------------------------------------------
1. Modified level_1_qc.c. No longer QCs ZDR data.
2. vosqc.f modified by Danny to fix TAMU problem. Experimental only.


v1.13 (6/15/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.8
----------------------------------------------
1. level_1.c, level_1_null_granule.c modified to use gv_utils to identify
   radar site. Removed file 'radar_sites'.
2. Requires gv_utils v1.8.
3. Added reference to gv_radar_site_info.data in level_1.html.

Note: 

   Level_1 is unable to process Berrimah data that is in RAPIC format.
   The reason is simple to explain but hard to implement.  Azimuth
   angles of one field type are shifted in other field types.
   This makes alignment of a field type for a particular ray problematic.
   Additionally, upper level sweeps are similarly misaligned.  The 
   current implementation of the TSDIS toolkit requires that the
   rays be properly aligned across all field types and all sweeps.


v1.12 (6/9/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.7
--------------------------------------------
* Corrected WSR88D_ID for Miami and Key West in radar_sites.
* Added qc_params_DARB, qc_params_TAMP, qc_params_MIAM, qc_params_KEYW,
  qc_params_LKCH, qc_params_NWBR, qc_params_CORC, qc_params_JACK,
  qc_params_TALL, qc_params_BROW, qc_params_GRAN, qc_params_TAMU,
  qc_params_HAWA, qc_params_THPH

--------------------------------------------
1. qc.f: Included JCET QC mod.
2. Updated documentation.
3. Added the capability for uninstalling the software.
4. level_1.c: VosValidityCheck(): Either 'DZ' or 'ZT' is OK.
5. Uncommented all site entries in 'radar_sites' and changed Berrimah site
   name from DARW to DARB.

v1.10 (1/26/98) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.5
---------------------------------------------
1. Increased char buffer size in 'ImgCreate' to accomodate
	 JCET's request for negative height values.
2. Added version# in the usage message of 'level_1_null_granule
3. vosqc.par: increased max steps to 26 for QC routine.
4. level_1.c: Changed decision algorithm regarding
   whether or not to write a VOS into a 1C-51 HDF file.
5. level_1.c: Set the date/time in the Radar_header to that of
   the first recorded ray of the VOS. This is a kludge to duck a
   UF-related problem discovered by JCET.
6. Requires rsl-v1.13.tgz or later.

----------------------------------------------
