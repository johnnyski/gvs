README for level_1: v1.19 (2/1/00) initially packaged w/ GVS v4.16.
============


level_1 uses the algorithm developed jointly by Daniel Rosenfeld and 
David Wolff.  This package contains the following executable files,
documentation, and data files:

    Executable files:
    ----------------
	* level_1-- This program produces 1C-51 and 1B-51 products by default.
                (It is created by the makefile). 

    Documentation:
    -------------
	* level_1.html	 -- documentation.

    Data files:
    -----------
    qc_params_* - Files contain qc parameters for specific sites.


              ------------------------------------------

(a) Documentation is located in *.html and can be viewed with netscape 
    or mosaic.

(b) The directories which you have installed the executable files for 
     this product should be in your search path.




EXECUTION NOTES:
================

1. Set enviroment variables: $GVS_DATA_PATH and $TSDISTK.

2. See section Known bugs/problems for known bugs/problems.


KNOWN BUGS/PROBLEMS:
====================

1. Level_1 is unable to process Berrimah data that is in RAPIC format.
   The reason is simple to explain but hard to implement.  Azimuth
   angles of one field type are shifted in other field types.
   This makes alignment of a field type for a particular ray problematic.
   Additionally, upper level sweeps are similarly misaligned.  The 
   current implementation of the TSDIS toolkit requires that the
   rays be properly aligned across all field types and all sweeps.
